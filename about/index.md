My current research interest focus on **educational applications of NLP**. Other research interests include **knowledge acquisition** for **machine reading comprehension** and **question answering**, particulary when **common sense knowledge** is required. I am also interested in temporal reasoning, especially on it's application to the clinical domain. On a personal note, I love sports and music.
